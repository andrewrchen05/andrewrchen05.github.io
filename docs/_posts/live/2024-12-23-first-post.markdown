I've always been attracted but at the same time scared of posting on the Internet. The Internet is forever, and free speech comes with consequences. Your views may be antithesis to some group of people who hold power over you, for example if you work in a corporate setting, as I do at the moment. Privacy is dead, especially now with LLMs. And even before it was possible to dredge up old, deleted posts and profiles.

Perhaps it is time to cede that true privacy is impossible now, or at least extremely difficult, for someone who wants to interact on the Internet regularly. Even with a pseudonym, as time goes on, the greater the chance of inadvertently exposing your true self. Satoshi had the right idea to drop off as soon as he knew Bitcoin could survive without him.

It feels different writing in my personal journal versus writing something that anyone could see. It feels almost risque, opening yourself to judgement, criticism, and rejection. It's like deciding to own up to a flirt rather than receding into yourself. I hope posting online will inject that pressure to espouse ideas more clearly (since people besides myself need to read it).
